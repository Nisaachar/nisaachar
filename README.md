Hello, I enjoy building applications and working in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. Here is a list of some of the projects I've completed.

#### / Movie Recommendation System | ETL Pipeline, GitHub API, SQLite, FunkSVD, Data Visualization
Â·	Extracted data using GitHub API, transformed it using data preprocessing techniques, and used SQLite database to store the processed data building a robust data pipeline.
Â·	Employed various recommendation techniques including Knowledge, Collaborative, Content, and Model-based approaches to tailor recommendations effectively.
Â·	Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, recommendation system design, and machine learning model deployment.

#### / Sentiment Analysis and Investigating NLP Data Models | GitHub | Data Preprocessing, Transformer Models, NLTK, Sklearn, Matplotlib
Â·	Conducted a thorough comparative study of sentiment analysis models within Natural Language Processing (NLP). Evaluated state-of-the-art machine learning models including AFINN, VADER, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and Hugging Faceâ€™s RoBERTa model, analyzing their performance.
Â·	The project was aimed to identify the most effective model for sentiment classification, providing valuable insights for NLP practitioners and researchers.

#### / Study Abroad | GitHub | React.js, MongoDB, NoSQL, Rest APIs, CI/CD, Unit Testing, Postman, UI, Full Stack
Â·	Developed a MERN stack website addressing challenges in pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in the US. Leveraged React.js and MongoDB (NoSQL) for frontend and backend respectively and wrote REST APIs for client-server communication.
Â·	Conducted unit testing with Mocha for reliability. Personalized the website appearance for improved user experience. Orchestrated continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub.

#### / Stock Market Prediction Framework | GitHub | LSTM, EDA, Docker, Streamlit, Cloud Architecture, Predictive Analysis
Â·	Engineered LSTM regression model for predictive analysis, forecasting stock market precisely. I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis on Yahoo Finance datasets and standardized data for optimal model performance.
Â·	Engineered a user-friendly web interface with Streamlit, enhancing user engagement and facilitating dynamic input. Implemented containerization to the solution with Docker to ensure scalability and seamlessly deployed it on the Google Cloud Platform for enhanced accessibility.

#### / Identifying Prospective Customers | k-Means Clustering, PCA, Standardization, Feature Scaling
Â·	Employed unsupervised learningâ€™s K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. Optimized K-Means performance through comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, including data analysis, imputation, standardization, and PCA.
Â·	Identified the optimal number of clusters using advanced evaluation methods such as Cumulative Variance, Silhouette Score, and the Elbow Method.
Â·	Utilized customer clusters to extrapolate insights from public data, effectively identifying potential customers and extracting actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
