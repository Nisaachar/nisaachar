### Profile: 
As a data science professional, I have leveraged my skills in OCR and computer vision to deliver impactful solutions for various domains, such as wastewater treatment, delivery warehousing, and document processing. Working with TCS for two years, I enhanced an OCR engine using Microsoft Azure, boosting accuracy from 87% to 91%. I also crafted a proof of concept for a wastewater treatment plant project, adapting solutions based on user stories. Additionally, I used Google Cloud Platform's computer vision technology to extract viable information from packages in a delivery warehouse project.

Currently, I am pursuing my MSCS at Purdue University, where I am expanding my knowledge and interest in data analysis. I have a keen eye for finding patterns and insights from data, and I enjoy applying my quick learning ability to build solutions that affect people and their experiences. I have also used my SQL skillset to develop a graphical user interface for a deployed database, providing various use cases such as sorting, joining tables, converting into CSV files, and downloading. I am open to full-time data science roles where I can utilize my expertise and passion for data.
